# Safe-Path-Planning-UAV-delivery
This code is part of a research internship where I used a variation of a project done at this link:https://github.com/TeixeiraMarcosV/Robust-Model-Predictive-Control-applied-to-UAV is continued. The idea is to control a drone (UAV) that has a load suspended by a rigid cable using MDP and THTS.
